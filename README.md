# ChromeServerInfo
**This is work in progress! None of the desired features work as of now.**

A Chrome extension to display information on the current
server. It shall make transparent
- The true server name (which is _not_ easily deducable from the URL)
- The trusting root certificate
- Change in trusting root certificate (in case there was a change)
